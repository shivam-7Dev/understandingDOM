/*
    1. Create an HTML file that contains at least one 
       of each of the following Node types:

    - DocumentType (DOCTYPE)
    - Element
    - Comment
    - Text

    2. Open your HTML file in your Browser's dev tools
       and inspect each of the nodes, then switch
       to the console to log out that node's "nodeType"
       property to confirm it is correct.

    *HINT: You can inspect a specific element then use
           "$0" in the console tab to refer to it
           (Eg: $0.nodeType)
