    1. Create an HTML file with a <head> with a
       <title> in it with some text, as well as
       a <body> tag
       
    2. In the body, add a <button> Element with
       the text "Play!" that when clicked, will 
       generate a random number between 0-10. If
       the number is greater than 7, it will display
       a paragraph with the text "You're lucky!",
       otherwise it will display a paragraph with the
       text "Better luck next time!".

    3. Open the file in your Browser and open up
       the dev tools to verify the randomizing
       behaviour when you click the button
