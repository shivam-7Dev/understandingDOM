/*
    1. Create an HTML file with a <head> with a
       <title> with some text. Add a <body> tag
       with an <h1> tag inside with some text.

    2. Open the file in your Browser and open up the
       dev tools alongside it to run some code

    3. In the console, how would you add a <style> tag
       to the <head> that will target elements
       with a class of "large" that changes their
       font-size to be 48px.

    4. Add the "large" class to the <h1> tag on the page
       once you have the <style> tag to confirm it works

    5. Make sure to test these in the console and
       confirm the results visually and in the DOM
