/*
    1. Create an HTML file with a <head> with a
       <title> with some text. Add a <body> tag
       with an <h1> tag inside with some text.

    2. Add a <style> tag that will target elements
       with a class of "large" that changes their
       font-size to be 48px.

    3. Open the file in your Browser and open up the
       dev tools alongside it to run some code

    4. What are a couple of ways to add and remove the
       "large" class to/from the <h1> tag?

    5. Make sure to test these in the console and
       confirm the results visually and in the DOM
