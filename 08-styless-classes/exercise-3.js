/*
    1. Create an HTML file with a <head> with a
       <title> with some text. Add a <body> tag
       with just a <script> tag inside it.

    2. How would you, using ONLY Javscript code inside
       the <script> tag:
       - Add a <div> tag that has a background colour
         of "salmon" that is centered horizontally on
         the screen with a size of 200px by 200px

    3. Open the file in your Browser and open up the
       dev tools alongside it

    4. Confirm the results visually and in the DOM
