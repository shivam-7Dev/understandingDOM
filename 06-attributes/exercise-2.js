/*
    1. Create a new HTML file that has the following
       Elements in it:
       - <head> with a <title> with some text in it
       - <body> with:
            - <h1> tag with some text
            - <button> tag with the text "Say Hello"

    2. Open up your file in your Browser and open the
       dev tools alongside it as well.

    3. In the dev tools, add the "onclick" attribute to the
       <button> element. This attribute will run the
       Javascript code in it's value. Make the button console
       log out "Why, hello there!" when clicked.
    
    4. Verify the changes in the DOM/Elements tab as well

    * We will get deeper in to Events in later videos
    ** These event handler attributes are bad practice!
